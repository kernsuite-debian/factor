Getting Help
============

Bugs that are encountered during a Factor run can be reported on the Factor GitHub issues page at https://github.com/lofar-astron/factor/issues. For other problems, the Prefactor FAQ at https://github.com/lofar-astron/prefactor/wiki/Documentation%3A-Faq is a good
place to look for solutions, as Factor uses the same generic pipeline as Prefactor.
