Factor structure
================

Factor effectively sets up and runs generic pipelines that perform the actual processing. The overall structure of facet calibration as done by Factor is shown in Figure :num:`factor-flowchart` below. The processing is divided into a number of operations, the division of which is largely determined by whether or not multiple operations may be run in parallel. In this flowchart, each operation is outlined with a black box.
