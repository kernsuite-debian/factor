Downloading and installing
--------------------------

.. note::

    If you are working on the LOFAR CEP III cluster, then Factor is already installed. All that needs to be done is to initialize your environment as follows (for the latest master version)::

        $ source ~rafferty/init_factor

    For earlier versions, append the version number to the file that is sourced. E.g.::

        $ source ~rafferty/init_factor_v1.2

Instructions for downloading and installing Factor on other systems are available on the Factor GitHub page at https://github.com/lofar-astron/factor.
